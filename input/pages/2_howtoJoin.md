This section describes how to connect your biobank to the [Sample Locator](https://samplelocator.bbmri.de) and what you need to have in place before you do so.

### About
The [Sample Locator](https://samplelocator.bbmri.de) is our central **non-commercial and open source service**, which enables scientists to search for specific research-relevant biosamples and related data across multiple academic biobanks distributed across Europe. Each biobank hosts a so-called Bridgehead, which connects to the central Sample Locator.

A Bridgehead comprises of two primary components:
* **The Blaze Store**. This holds the actual data being searched. This store must be filled by you, generally by running an ETL on your locally stored data to turn it into the standardized FHIR format that we require.
* **The Connector**. This is the component that connects to the outside world. It collects the currently waiting queries from the Sample Locator, runs them against the Blaze Store, and returns aggregated results to the Sample Locator.

In order to make the data at your site searchable by the Sample Locator, you must *install a Bridgehead at your site*, *fill the Store with data*, and *register the Connector with the Sample Locator*.

More details about the functional principles of our IT infrastructure the can be found [here](https://www.bbmri.de/biobanking/it/functional-principle/?L=1).

The **organization behind** the development is the [German Biobank Node](https://www.bbmri.de/?L=1) in cooperation with [BBMRI-ERIC](http://www.bbmri-eric.eu), sponsored by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research](https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html).


### General Requirements
1. Hardware:  
* 16 GB RAM
* 50 GB disk space (depends on amount of data)
* 2 or 4 CPU cores
* OS with support for [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (e.g. Linux, Windows 10 with hyper-V, macOS)
* Outgoing http and https
* Proxies are supported. No VPN or incoming ports required. 
* Firewall to restrict access from internal network is recommended.

2. Software:
We recommend using Docker for installing the Bridgehead components on your site, and we make this easy for you by providing a fully configured Docker bundle for this purpose. Manual installation is also possible but entails significantly more work. So you will need to install:
* [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
* [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

3. Data protection:  
Read this [Data protection concept](https://www.bbmri.de/biobanking/it/data-protection-concept/?L=1) carefully and submit it to your data protection authorities. The **data protection concept must be approved** by your local data protection officer.

4. Data access:  
To fill the Store of the Bridgehead you need access to clinical data from your **local source systems**. An overview about the clinical data which we want to provide in the ferderated search can be found [here](1_overview.html).

5. Data format:  
The Store of the Bridgehead stores data as **HL7 FHIR® Bundles**. To import data into the Store, they must be harmonised and converted. Each site must build an ETL-process (extract, transform, load) to harmonise the structure of the data and translate them to fit predefined FHIR® profiles.
You can find our FHIR® profile for the basic data set [here](https://simplifier.net/bbmri.de) and for the oncology data set [here](https://simplifier.net/oncology).


### Guides to install, fill and connect a Bridgehead
We provide a step-by-step installation guide on the [Bridgehead Deployment GitHub page](https://github.com/samply/bridgehead-deployment).

All of the components that make up the Bridgehead are open source. Non-technical descriptions of the components can be found [here](https://www.bbmri.de/biobanking/it/open-source-software/?L=1). If you wish to explore the source code of the components deployed, both locally at your site as well as centrally, please visit the [Component Finder](https://samply.github.io/samply-component-finder/). A complete list of our source code repositories can be found in the [GitHub samply Repository](https://github.com/samply).
